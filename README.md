# Tandem-Queue-Simulation
***
***
A service facility consists of two servers in series (tandem), each with its own FIFO queue (see Fig. 1.50). A customer completing service at server 1 proceeds to server 2, while a customer completing service at server 2 leaves the facility. Assume that the interarrival times of customers to server 1 are IID exponential random variables with mean 1 minute. Service times of customers at server 1 are IID exponential random variables with mean 0.7 minute, and at server 2 are IID exponential random variables with mean 0.9 minute. Run the simulation for exactly 1000 minutes and estimate for each server the expected average delay in queue of a customer, the expected timeaverage number of customers in queue, and the expected utilization.

suppose that with probability 0.2, a customer completing service at server 2 is dissatisfi ed with her overall service and must be completely served over again (at least once) by both servers. Defi ne the delay in queue of a customer (in a particular queue) to be the total delay in that queue for all of that customerâ€™s passes through the facility. Simulate the facility for each of the following
cases (estimate the same measures as before):
***
  a) Dissatisfied customers join the tail of queue 1.
***
  b) Dissatisfied customers join the head of queue 1.
